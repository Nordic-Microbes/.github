# Nordic Microbes Github organization
This Github organization is for employees working at Nordic Microbes A/S.  
Here, we can collaborate on programming projects, using version control and ensuring privacy.  
This README contains a short introduction to Github and Git, and outlines how to download and use the code in the repositories.  
 
## I am not a coder, why is this for me? 
This organization is a space where the people who do produce executable code can upload their projects, so they are automatically updated when new changes are made to the programs.  
For you, this means that you no longer have to use an out-dated version of a script, because the maintainer of the script hasn't told you that there is a new version available.  
Now, you can simply go to the program's repo (we'll get to that in a bit) and check for a new version.  

Think of this organization as a cloud space for programs developed for Nordic Microbes.

## How do I download the programs?
A Github profile contains a collection of **repositories**.  
These are self-contained coding projects, that can be downloaded by anyone who is provided access. As a member of the organization, you will have access.  
To download a repository, navigate to the [Nordic Microbes organization page](https://github.com/Nordic-Microbes) and click the "Repositories" tab at the top of the page and navigate to the repo you are interested in.  
Once there, you will be met by a readme page that usually contains documentation about the repo. This could be:  
- Installation
- Usage
- Dependencies
- Output
  
Among many other things.  
The big green "Code" button allows you to "clone" (download) a repo. You can simply download all the code as a .zip-file or, for more advanced users, use the web URL in a terminal.  
The repo's readme will most likely tell you how to specifically install the repo that you're interested in. This can be different between repos.

And that's it! You are now on your way to downloading and using repos stored on Github.

## Contribution and writing code
Everyone at Nordic Microbes can create and fork repositories.  
The suggested workflow for creating software at Nordic Microbes is to either:  
- Create a new repo in the Nordic Microbes organization
- Or create a new repo on your personal profile and transfer ownership to Nordic Microbes

You will have to **fork** a **branch** from Nordic Microbes to contribute with changes to the code.  
Forking a repo is Git-jargon. Git is a programming language for tracking changes in code - basically a save/load button for your coding projects.  
You can learn the basics of Git [here](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners).  

Basically, creating a new branch allows you to make changes to the code without altering the main code. You can use your branch to create new features or edit existing ones, while users can still use the code as usual.  
Forking a branch allows you to keep a copy of the branch on your personal Github profile. Thereby, you can edit the code with Git (version control) providing better control over what has been changed when and why.  
When you've finished a feature, you push the branch back to the repo at Nordic Microbes and submit a pull request.  
The lead maintainer can then inspect the changes and merge the pull request if accepted.  

And that is all there is to it!  
Remember, it is good practice to document your code so both you and others can easily understand what it does and why it does it.
